								<span itemprop="description"><small>BACKGROUND:Virtual reality (VR) use as a platform for vestibular rehabilitation is widespread. However, the utility of VR based vestibular assessments remains unknown. OBJECTIVE:To compare dynamic visual acuity (DVA) scores, perceived balance, and perceived dizziness when using traditional versus VR environments for DVA testing among healthy individuals. METHODS:DVA testing occurred for both a traditional clinical protocol and in a VR variant. Horizontal, vertical, and no head motion conditions were conducted for both clinical and VR test protocols. DVA scores, balance ratings, and dizziness ratings were obtained per condition. Two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures were used to assess differences in DVA scores, balance, and dizziness ratings. RESULTS:No differences in DVA results, balance or dizziness ratings were observed when comparing traditional clinical protocol versus the VR variant. Differences across head motion conditions were observed, with no motion trials exhibiting significantly higher DVA scores and perceived balance, and lower perceived dizziness compared to vertical and horizontal head motion. Vertical head motion exhibited this same trend compared to horizontal. CONCLUSION:DVA testing conducted in VR demonstrated clinical utility for each measure. Effects of head motion were similar across test variants, indicating DVA testing in VR produces similar effects on vestibular function than traditional clinical testing. Additional research should be conducted to assess the feasibility of VR assessment in individuals with vestibular disorder. </small></span>

								<span itemprop="description"><small>The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an internationally recognized medical vocabulary that enables semantic interoperability across various biomedical terminologies. To use its knowledge, the users must understand its complex knowledge structure, a structure that is not interoperable or is not compliant with any known biomedical and healthcare standard. Further, the users also need to have good technical skills to understand its inner working and interact with UMLS in general. These barriers might cause UMLS usage concerns among inter-disciplinary users in biomedical and healthcare informatics. Currently, there exists no terminology service that normalizes UMLS’s complex knowledge structure to a widely accepted interoperable healthcare standard and allows easy access to its knowledge, thus hiding its workings. The objective of this research is to design and implement a light-weight terminology service that allows easy access to UMLS knowledge structured using the fast health interoperability resources (FHIR) standard, a widely accepted interoperability healthcare standard. The developed terminology service, named UMLS FHIR, leverages FHIR resources and features, and can easily be integrated into any application to consume UMLS knowledge in the FHIR format without the need to understand UMLS’s native knowledge structure and its internal working.</small></span>

However, the data captured in an EHR is only accessible to the providers and specialists within an organization, but not the patient. The concept of a Personal Health Record (PHR) is to allow the patients to record and manage their health data beyond EHR and if possible, see the EHR data in the PHR. Experts agree that bi-directional communication between the PHR and EHR allows the PHR to be more effective and a valuable tool for both the providers and patients. Communicating near real-time patient recorded data in PHR with an EHR will allow the provider(s) to make appropriate clinical decisions and patients can see any changes to his/her diagnostics or treatment plans. This research explores and critically analyzes HL7 FHIR to design and prototype an interoperable mobile PHR that conforms to the HL7 PHR Functional Model and allows bi-directional communication with OpenEMR.</small></span>

										experts highly recommend to include physical activity in
										everyone's daily routine irrespective of gender or age as it
										helps to improve various medical issues or curb potential
										issues. Simultaneously, experts are also diligently trying to
										provide various healthcare services (interventions, plans,
										exercise routines, etc.) for promoting healthy living and
										increasing physical activity in one's ever increasing hectic
										schedules. With the introduction of wearables, individuals are
										able to keep track, analyze, and visualize their daily
										physical activities. However, there seems to be no common
										agreed standard for representing, gathering, aggregating and
										analyzing an individual's physical activity data from
										disparate multiple sources (exercise pans, multiple wearables,
										etc.). This issue makes it highly impractical to develop any
										data-driven physical activity applications and healthcare
										programs. Further, the inability to integrate the physical
										activity data into an individual's Electronic Health Record to
										provide a wholistic image of that individual's health is still
										eluding the experts. This article has identified three primary
										reasons for this potential issue. First, there is no agreed
										standard, both structure and semantic, for representing and
										sharing physical activity data across disparate systems.
										Second, various organizations (e.g., LA fitness, Gold's Gym,
										etc.) and research backed interventions and programs still
										primarily rely on paper or unstructured format (such as text
										or notes) to keep track of the data generated from physical
										activities. Finally, most of the wearable devices operate in
										silos. This article identifies the underlying problem,
										explores the idea of reusing existing standards, and
										identifies the essential modules required to move forward.</small></span>

										have gained increasing usage to augment an application with

										privacy and security plays a major role in domains where
										sensitive information is handled, such as case studies of rare

										information is provided by various mechanisms at the

										Role Based Access Control. However, these approaches leave

										knowledge ranging from bioinformatics such as gene, protein,
										protein interactions, etc. to clinical/healthcare informatics
										knowledge such as diseases, symptoms, treatment, medication,
										etc. Currently, one medical knowledge source that encapsulates
										a broad spectrum of medical knowledge is the Unified Medical
										Language System (UMLS), which can be defined as a compendium
										of diverse medical ontological standards. The primary
										components of the UMLS are: Semantic Network
										(UMLS-SN)-designed by interconnecting well-defined semantic
										types with semantic relationships, and Metathesaurus
										(UMLS-META)- the base of UMLS system that is comprised of
										millions of medical concepts from diverse medical standards.
										However, within the biomedical and health informatics
										community, the concepts of software engineering and domain
										modeling (using meta-models such as ERD, UML, and XML) are
										very successful in designing and implementing
										biomedical/health domain application models. In the current
										status, the UMLS-SN is primarily employed for classification
										of medical concepts in UMLS-META, but UMLS-SN knowledge can't
										be viewed or employed as a modeling framework for designing
										ontological models and is restricted to the UMLS environment.
										Thus, the impact of the biomedical semantics captured by
										UMLS-SN might be minimal in medical facilities, research and
										healthcare organizations that are highly influenced by
										software engineering, meta-models and domain model-based
										practices. In order fill this gap, the authors propose a
										meta-modeling framework for UMLS-SN based on the UML Profile
										(built using UML meta-model) that will result in a customized
										domain specific meta-model. This specialized meta-model that
										encapsulates the medical knowledge semantics of UMLS-SN can
										then be employed for designing ontological models or relevant
										healthcare application models and simultaneously be coherent
										with software meta-models and domain modeling practices.</small></span>
