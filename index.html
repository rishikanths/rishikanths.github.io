										<p>Experts recommend to include physical activity in everyone’s daily routine 
										as it helps to curb various medical issues. They provide diverse healthcare 
										services (e.g., interventions, exercise routine, personal trainer plan, 
										therapy, etc.) to promote healthy living and to increase 
										physical activity in one’s ever increasing hectic schedules. An individual 
										generates a lot of data when he/she performs a physical activity. 
										However, this data (exercises, training plans, etc.) and any other associated data 
										(e.g., results, vitals, calories, weight, etc.) is not represented using commonly
										agreed standards. The lack of standards has given rise to two primary issues. 
										First, interoperability issues don’t allow the physical activity data to be shared 
										and integrated with heterogeneous healthcare systems. Second, various organizations
										and research programs still majorly rely on paper to record the data.
										This makes it highly impractical to develop any data-driven physical activity
										applications or evidence-based program. This article provides a detailed analysis
										of the problem and provides a potential solution in terms of extending

										<p>Medical experts highly recommend to include physical
											activity in everyone's daily routine irrespective of gender
											or age as it helps to improve various medical issues or curb
											potential issues. Simultaneously, experts are also diligently
											trying to provide various healthcare services (interventions,
											plans, exercise routines, etc.) for promoting healthy living
											and increasing physical activity in one's ever increasing
											hectic schedules. With the introduction of wearables,
											individuals are able to keep track, analyze, and visualize
											their daily physical activities. However, there seems to be
											no common agreed standard for representing, gathering,
											aggregating and analyzing an individual's physical activity
											data from disparate multiple sources (exercise pans, multiple
											wearables, etc.). This issue makes it highly impractical to
											develop any data-driven physical activity applications and
											healthcare programs. Further, the inability to integrate the
											physical activity data into an individual's Electronic Health
											Record to provide a wholistic image of that individual's
											health is still eluding the experts. This article has
											identified three primary reasons for this potential issue.
											First, there is no agreed standard, both structure and
											semantic, for representing and sharing physical activity data
											across disparate systems. Second, various organizations
											(e.g., LA fitness, Gold's Gym, etc.) and research backed
											interventions and programs still primarily rely on paper or
											unstructured format (such as text or notes) to keep track of
											the data generated from physical activities. Finally, most of
											the wearable devices operate in silos. This article

											reusing existing standards, and identifies the essential

											Ontologies have gained increasing usage to augment an
											application with domain knowledge, particularly in
											healthcare, where they represent knowledge ranging from:
											bioinformatics data such as protein, gene, etc. to biomedical
											informatics such as diseases, diagnosis, symptoms, etc.
											However, the current ontology development efforts and process
											are data intensive and construction based, creating
											ontologies for specific applications/requirements, rather
											than designing an abstract ontological solution(s) that can
											be reusable across the domain using a well-defined design
											process. To address this deficiency, the work presented
											herein positions ontologies as software engineering artifact
											that allows them to be placed into the position to share the
											captured domain conceptualization and its vocabulary
											involving disparate domain backgrounds, that can then be
											created, imported, exported and re-used using different
											frameworks, tools and techniques. Towards this end, the
											authors propose an agile software process for ontologies
											referred to as the Hybrid Ontology Design & Development Model

										<p>Information privacy and security plays a major role in
											domains where sensitive information is handled, such as case
											studies of rare diseases. Currently, security for accessing
											any sensitive information is provided by various mechanisms
											at the user/system level by employing access control models
											such as Role Based Access Control. However, these approaches
											leave security at the knowledge level unattended, which can
											be inadequate. For example, in healthcare, ontology-based
											information extraction is employed for extracting medical
											knowledge from sensitive structured/unstructured data
											sources. These information extraction systems act on
											sensitive data sources which are protected against
											unauthorized access at the system level based on the user,
											context and permissions, but the knowledge that can be
											extracted from these sources is not. In this paper we tackle
											the security or access control at the knowledge level by
											presenting a model, to enforce knowledge security/access by
											leveraging knowledge sources (currently focused on RDF) with
											the RBAC model. The developed model filters out knowledge by
											means of binary permissions on the knowledge source,

									<div class="abstractTitle collapsible-header">Abstract</div>
									<div class="collapsible-body">
										<p>In the domain of biomedical and health informatics,
											ontologies are widely used to capture knowledge ranging from
											bioinformatics such as gene, protein, protein interactions,
											etc. to clinical/healthcare informatics knowledge such as
											diseases, symptoms, treatment, medication, etc. Currently,
											one medical knowledge source that encapsulates a broad
											spectrum of medical knowledge is the Unified Medical Language
											System (UMLS), which can be defined as a compendium of
											diverse medical ontological standards. The primary components
											of the UMLS are: Semantic Network (UMLS-SN)-designed by
											interconnecting well-defined semantic types with semantic
											relationships, and Metathesaurus (UMLS-META)- the base of
											UMLS system that is comprised of millions of medical concepts
											from diverse medical standards. However, within the
											biomedical and health informatics community, the concepts of
											software engineering and domain modeling (using meta-models
											such as ERD, UML, and XML) are very successful in designing
											and implementing biomedical/health domain application models.
											In the current status, the UMLS-SN is primarily employed for
											classification of medical concepts in UMLS-META, but UMLS-SN
											knowledge can't be viewed or employed as a modeling framework
											for designing ontological models and is restricted to the
											UMLS environment. Thus, the impact of the biomedical
											semantics captured by UMLS-SN might be minimal in medical
											facilities, research and healthcare organizations that are
											highly influenced by software engineering, meta-models and
											domain model-based practices. In order fill this gap, the
											authors propose a meta-modeling framework for UMLS-SN based
											on the UML Profile (built using UML meta-model) that will
											result in a customized domain specific meta-model. This
											specialized meta-model that encapsulates the medical
											knowledge semantics of UMLS-SN can then be employed for
											designing ontological models or relevant healthcare
											application models and simultaneously be coherent with
											software meta-models and domain modeling practices.</p>

										<p>In the past decade, clinical patient data has played a
											pivotal role in clinical and translational research in
											support of new treatment options, medical interventions, drug
											development, etc. In support of this process, researchers
											require massive integrated data sets generated via a health
											information exchange (HIE) to centralize and automate the
											development and maintenance of a clinical research data
											warehouse (CRDW). The data harvested from the CRDW is
											obtained by cleansing transactional clinical databases (TCD)
											used for daily clinical activities. Traditionally, TCD schema
											and CRDW data models only capture conceptual patient data,
											often neglecting to address the contextual and semantic
											information attached to such data that is crucial for
											clinical analysis. In this paper, we propose a star schema
											and associated extraction process to enhance the collection
											of contextual and semantic information in support of CRDW
											that leverages HL7 Clinical Document Architecture in
											conjunction with the Reference Information Model.</p>

										<p>Interactions between prescription medications,
											over-the-counter drugs, and nutritional supplements can have
											negative consequences for patients. There is a need for the
											reconciliation across this spectrum spurred on by the
											adoption of electronic medical records by healthcare
											providers and the usage of personal health records by
											patients. In such a setting, unifying information from
											multiple sources through automated reconciliation can address
											adverse medication interactions, track adverse medication
											reactions, and avoid overmedication. This requires mitigating
											the integration issues of multiple data sources and systems.
											In this paper, we leverage Harvard University's SMART
											framework to perform medication reconciliation across
											different data sources, with the long-term goal of providing
											robust decision support for overmedication and adverse
											interactions. Our prototype application SMARTSync provides
											ontology-backed recognition of interactions, decision
											support, and is able to warn a patient (or notify a provider)
											of potential medication problems.</p>
